/*
We can prove that the stack has at most n
elements and the queue has at most 2(nâˆ’1) elements. Therefore, DFS is much more
economical:  it uses memory proportional to the tree depth.  BFS uses memory
proportional to the size of the tree.

Parsing
A parser is part of a compiler. A compiler is a program that translates a sequence
of characters, which represents a program, into a sequence of low-level instructions
that can be executed on a machine.
