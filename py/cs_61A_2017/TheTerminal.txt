On a Mac: Hold âŒ˜ (command) and press spacebar; this will open up the Spotlight Search.
Type "Terminal", and you should see the app icon pop up. Double click it to open. 

 For Mac users, I
recommend you right click the icon in your home bar, and select "Options > Keep in Dock".
You will be using this app a lot in this class

1.Terminal:
rename:
mv /home/user/oldname /home/user/newname

2.gzip
In order to "zip" a directory, the correct command would be

tar -zcvf archive.tar.gz directory/ 
This will tell tar to c (create) an archive from the files in directory (tar is recursive by default), compress it using the z (gzip) algorithm, store the output as a f (file) named archive.tar.gz, and v (verbosely) list (on /dev/stderr so it doesn't affect piped commands) all the files it adds to the archive.

To decompress and unpack the archive into the current directory you would use

tar -zxvf archive.tar.gz
That command is effectively the same as

gunzip < archive.tar.gz | tar -xv
